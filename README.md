# Neocortica v1.0.0

Vibe researching toolkit — AI-powered academic research automation, from literature discovery to experiment execution.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a work-in-progress personal project, under active development.

## What It Does

- Search and filter academic papers from Google Scholar
- Deep reference exploration via Semantic Scholar citation graphs
- Convert arXiv papers, PDFs, and web pages to AI-readable markdown
- Web search via Brave Search API for non-academic sources
- Full-text caching for offline access and repeated queries
- GPU experiment execution on remote pods via session sharing (export session → transfer → resume on GPU pod)
- Five-stage research pipeline: survey → gaps → ideas → design → execution

## How It Works

Most academic AI tools only read abstracts to triage papers. Neocortica downloads the full paper text, converts it to markdown, and lets AI evaluate based on complete methodology, experiments, and discussion.

Multi-MCP architecture: research skills orchestrate external MCP servers for academic search, web search, and GPU execution. Stage 5 uses session sharing to hand off full research context to remote GPU pods.

## Research Pipeline

Five-stage iterative pipeline: Topic → Literature Survey → Gap Analysis → Idea Generation → Experiment Design → Experiment Execution

Each stage (1–4) uses SEARCH→READ→REFLECT→EVALUATE cycles with autonomous gap discovery and dynamic stopping conditions. Stage 5 exports the full session (with all accumulated research context) to a remote GPU pod via session sharing, where it resumes and executes the experiment autonomously.

**Key Features**:

- 6 parallel searches per iteration (3 google-scholar-scraper + 3 brave_web_search)
- Two-step enrich pipeline: paper_searching → paper_fetching
- Web page pipeline: brave_web_search → web_fetching → web_content
- Three-pass reading protocol (High/Medium/Low rating)
- State inheritance between stages (knowledge + papersRead + urlsVisited)
- Zero external validation cost
- Dynamic stopping: gaps cleared, no progress for 3 rounds, or target reached
- Session sharing for experiment execution: export full research context → transfer to GPU pod → resume
- Checkpoint-based phase control via round-trip session export/import

### neocortica-web Setup

Clone and install the web page MCP server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Pthahnix/Neocortica-Web.git
cd Neocortica-Web
npm install

| `APIFY_TOKEN` | Apify API token (for rag-web-browser) | [Apify](https://console.apify.com/account#/integrations) |

## Quick Start

1. Install prerequisites above
2. Copy `.mcp.example.json` to `.mcp.json` and fill in your API keys and paths
3. Set up `.env`:

```bash
DIR_CACHE=.cache/
API_KEY_RUNPOD=your-runpod-key          # optional, for experiment execution
```

4. Claude Code will auto-discover all tools from the configured MCP servers.

## Roadmap

### Session Sharing — Distributed Experiment Execution

**Strategic pivot** (2026-03-16): replacing the custom HTTP relay protocol with session sharing for Stage 5 experiment execution.

The key insight: Claude Code's native work unit is the **session**. Instead of building a custom protocol that spawns a fresh CC process and loses all context, we export the full session — including all knowledge accumulated across Stages 1-4 — and resume it on a remote GPU pod. The remote CC "remembers everything" and executes the experiment with full research context.

Inspired by [cc-go-on](https://github.com/Johnixr/cc-go-on) (session export/encrypt/share/resume for AI coding assistants).

**Flow**:
```
Local CC (Stages 1-4 complete)
    → Export session (tar.gz + encrypt)
    → Transfer to RunPod GPU pod
    → Remote CC imports + resumes with full context
    → Executes experiment autonomously
    → Exports results session back
    → Local CC imports results
```

This approach reduces code complexity by 90%+, preserves full research context, and aligns with CC's native architecture rather than fighting it.
